Even though I had created many WordPress, Blogger, Start-from-scratch websites using code and tools. This is the first time I'm making one seriously for my portfolio. This page is made with Astro and the template is taken from this repo: https://github.com/TimWitzdam/astro-minimal-portfolio-template

My birthday is in 2 days and I will be graduating within a year. So I'm starting to get serious with my online presence and other activities. With me best luck!
