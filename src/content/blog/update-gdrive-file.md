Suppose you have a resume uploaded to Google Drive, and you've shared its link across every platform you know off. Now you want to update the content of your resume, but you'd rather not go through the hassle of changing the URL everywhere. ðŸ« 

You can simply click on the more actions (â‹®) of the file -> Select File information -> Manage versions.

Now upload a new version. That's it. Your file is now updated without changing its URL.
