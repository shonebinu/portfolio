I built a new portfolio website using [Astro](https://astro.build/), starting from their basic blog template.

For styling, Iâ€™m using [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), with icons from [Lucide](https://lucide.dev/).

Although Iâ€™ve had portfolios before, Iâ€™ve never created one from the ground up with my own ideas.
