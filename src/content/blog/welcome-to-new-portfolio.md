I built a new portfolio using [Astro](https://astro.build/), starting from their basic blog template. I removed all the default styles and started completely from scratch.

For styling, Iâ€™m using [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), with icons from [Lucide](https://lucide.dev/). The background texture comes from [Transparent Textures](https://www.transparenttextures.com/).

Although Iâ€™ve had portfolios before, Iâ€™ve never created one entirely from scratch until now.
