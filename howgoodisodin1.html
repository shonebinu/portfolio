<h1>How Good is Odin Project? Review by a student.</h1>
<p>Everyone new to learning to code at least has heard of Odin Project. The big promises we see in the programming
    communities on Reddit, Youtubers making content about how their Odin Journey went etc.</p>
<p>For people who don't know what the "Odin Project" is, it is an Open Source project maintained by professionals to
    teach newbies to learn to code. It is completely free to use and it contains a great number of courses and
    curricula.</p>
<p>I'm a newbie coder who just got a computer degree in a near college. To be frank, I'm trying to learn to code for the
    last 3 years but have never focused intentionally. But due to several household problems and other future worries, I
    have started to learn deep into coding again. As every fresher, I was in the deep sea of analysis paralysis and
    jumping between courses. Finally, I stopped it once I find Odin Project, I feel like it suits my style, it is the
    latest and always updated, and it is fast to complete since it is text-based. Also, since they link other resources
    in their curriculum, it is easy for me to learn more about specific topics.</p>
<p>Trust me, I have bought about jumped around more than 20 courses in my last 3 years, but I have never been focused on
    one course this much. Every time I open Odin, I have a monstrous urge to complete at least one chapter before my
    bed.</p>
<p>So far, I'm near the end of the foundation course and I'm loving it. They always include the latest tech unlike those
    old and un-updated courses on many big platforms around the globe. </p>
<p>This is my initial review of the Odin Project, I will update and upload new content every now and then on Odin
    Project.</p>
<p>Thank You.</p>
